# :hammer_and_wrench: My Dotfiles: Declarative Chaos, Elegantly Managed

Welcome to my dotfiles repo‚Äîa lovingly crafted mess of scripts, configs, and automation rituals designed to tame the wild beast that is cross-platform setup. If you're here, you're either me (hi future n3ddu8 üëã), a curious engineer, or someone who clicked the wrong link. Either way, buckle up.

## :yawning_face: TLDR

```shell
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
. ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.chezmoi
chezmoi init --apply $YOURGITHUBUSER
```

## :rocket: What This Is

This repo uses [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to manage my personal and professional environments across:

- :window: Windows
- :penguin: Linux (x86_64 + aarch64)
- :apple: macOS
- :shell: WSL2

It‚Äôs a work in progress, but the goal is simple: one command, full setup, zero regrets.

## :mage_man: Philosophy

Why Nix? Because I like my setups like I like my coffee: reproducible, cross-platform, and slightly over-engineered.

I started with Homebrew, but it turns out Linux aarch64 support is... aspirational. GUI apps? Also nope. So I pivoted to Nix‚Äînot because I wanted to summon the full wrath of the Nix community (‚Äújust use Home Manager!‚Äù), but because:

- It works on everything.
- It speaks architecture fluently.
- It lets me pretend I‚Äôm a wizard casting spells with `nix-env`.

Yes, I know about Home Manager and Nix Darwin. No, I‚Äôm not ready. Let me live.

## :package: Package Management

Packages are defined in `.chezmoidata/packages.yaml`, split into:

- `common.nix`: Stuff I want everywhere!
- `host.nix`: Stuff I want everywhere that isn't a conatiner!

Install logic lives in `run_onchange_install-packages.sh.tmpl`, which chezmoi renders and runs when things change. It‚Äôs templated, declarative, and slightly cursed.

## :test_tube: Setup Instructions

1. **Install Nix**  
   ```shell
   curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
   . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
   ```
   (you may need some prereqs dependong on how bare-bones your system is)
   ```shell
   sudo apt update && \
     sudo apt install curl xz-utils
   ```

2. **Install Chezmoi**
   ```shell
   nix-env -iA nixpkgs.chezmoi
   chezmoi init --apply $YOURGITHUBUSER
   ```

3. **Let the magic happen**</br>
Chezmoi will apply configs, detect WSL2 (if applicable), and run the install script to pull in packages via Nix.

4. **Profit**</br>
You now have bat, gh, neovim, ripgrep, starship, zoxide, and more. If you're on WSL2, you get extra goodies like Docker, Devpod, Ghostty, and tmux.

## :jigsaw: Future Plans

- Add support for macOS and native Linux setups.

- Introduce Homebrew (again) for macOS where Nix isn‚Äôt ideal.

- Maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîembrace Home Manager and Nix Darwin.

- Expand package definitions to include GUI apps, fonts, and other creature comforts.

- Refactor into a modular, layered architecture that reflects my engineering philosophy.

## :open_book: Notes

- `.chezmoiignore` ignores README.md because I don‚Äôt want chezmoi touching this masterpiece.

- `.chezmoidata` contains templated logic for detecting WSL2.

- `private_git_config` is where I keep my Git secrets. No peeking.

## :brain: Why This Matters

This isn‚Äôt just dotfiles‚Äîit‚Äôs a living, breathing reflection of my workflow rituals, engineering values, and refusal to settle for ‚Äúclose enough.‚Äù It‚Äôs declarative, reproducible, and built to scale across environments without losing its soul.

## :question: FAQ: Questions Nobody Asked But I Answered Anyway

**Q:** Why not just use Ansible? 
**A:** Because I like pain. Also because Ansible doesn‚Äôt speak Nix, and I‚Äôm trying to build a declarative utopia, not a YAML swamp.

**Q:** Why not use Home Manager like a normal Nix user? 
**A:** Because I‚Äôm not normal. I‚Äôm emotionally invested in scripting my own onboarding rituals. Also, I like knowing exactly which part of my setup broke.

**Q:** Why not use GUI tools? 
**A:** Because I believe in the terminal. If I wanted buttons, I‚Äôd be a frontend developer. (No shade. Okay, some shade.)

**Q:** Why is your install script templated in Go text format? 
**A:** Because chezmoi said so. I don‚Äôt make the rules‚ÄîI just bend them until they fit.

**Q:** Why not just use one package manager? 
**A:** Because I live on the edge. Also because Nix is the only one that doesn‚Äôt cry when I switch from x86_64 to aarch64.

**Q:** Why is your .chezmoidata file trying to detect WSL2? 
**A:** Because WSL2 is a beautiful lie and I need to treat it like the special snowflake it is.

**Q:** Why not just use Docker for everything? 
**A:** Because I like my dotfiles to touch grass. Also, containers don‚Äôt solve existential dread.

**Q:** Why is your README so sarcastic? 
**A:** Because engineering is serious, but dotfiles are personal. This is my playground, not a compliance audit.

**Q:** Are you okay? 
**A:** Define ‚Äúokay.‚Äù If by ‚Äúokay‚Äù you mean ‚Äúdeep in a recursive dotfile refactor while debating the merits of ephemeral lock files,‚Äù then yes. If you mean ‚Äútouching grass,‚Äù then no. But spiritually? I‚Äôm thriving.
